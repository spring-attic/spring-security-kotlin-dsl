= Spring Security Kotlin DSL

**Note**: The native Kotlin Domain Specific Language (DSL) for servlet based applications has been integrated into https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security[Spring Security] as of version https://spring.io/blog/2020/01/08/spring-security-5-3-0-m1-released[5.3.0.M1].
Servlet based applications no longer need to add this project as an additional dependency.
Reactive applications should continue to use this project for a native Kotlin DSL.

== Dependencies
Spring Cloud Kotlin DSL is an additional dependency you can add to your Spring project.
It is an extension to Spring Security, and does not replace it.

```kotlin
implementation("org.springframework.security.dsl:spring-security-kotlin-dsl:0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT")

implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security")
```

== Sample Configuration
This is a sample configuration, that enables form login for all endpoints and uses the login page `"/log-in"`.

```kotlin
@Configuration
class SecurityConfig: WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter() {
    override fun configure(http: HttpSecurity?) {
        http {
            authorizeRequests {
                authorize(anyRequest, authenticated)
            }
            formLogin {
                loginPage = "/log-in"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
